An azure planet's slow rotation born
From proud young men who pulled their lovers nigh.
Ere now, a gentle spin helped our orb
Discover its route through blank space and time.
Alas the friendly ball, it rolls no more
I saw your dear face, everything else froze.
Earth won some battles, but it lost the war.
But ya know as Kurt V. said so it goes.
Now nothing will remain if we divide
Your total trips around the nearest star
By standard count that fingers will provide.
I write some lyrics, pick up my guitar.
  Wish happy birthday to you with my song.
  We keenly kiss, caress, touch all night long.
